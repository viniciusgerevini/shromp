# 🦐 Shromp

A chill static docs/site generator that shrimply works.

## Features and principles

- Write your content in markdown, and when ready, simply "translate" it to a site that mirrors your source files.
- Supports multiple locales and versioning out-of-the-box. You can have both or neither. It's fully configurable. 
- Comes with a boilerplate for reference, already prepared with versioning, light/dark mode and localisation selection.
