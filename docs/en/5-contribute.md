# Contribute

Let's keep it simple!

- Shromp's goal is too be simple, so I'd prefer not to bloat it with unncessary or niche features. If you implemented something that you think would be a great addition to the project, feel free to start a discussion, open an issue or even raising a PR.
- Report any bugs [here](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/shromp/issues)
- For more open ended discussions, looking for help, or sharing your projects, check out our [discussions forum](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/shromp/discussions)

You can also contribute by creating cool themes! If I get any theme submission I will create a section in these docs to link to them.
