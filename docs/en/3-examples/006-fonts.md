# Custom Icon Fonts (the easy way)

Icon fonts are great for websites as they scale well and are easy to style.

But sometimes it's hard to find all the icons you need in the same pack. Or worse, you might want just a couple of items, but have to import a bigger font set because there is no way around it.

That's why [Fontello](https://fontello.com/) exists. It's an open-source icon font generator. You select the icons you want, and you can generate the files for yourself.

I have no affiliation with Fontello. I just found out about it when looking for icons for shromp's default theme and enjoyed how easy it was to get it working.

_unfortunately, no shrimp icon available :(_
