# Shromp

A chill static docs/site generator that shrimply works.

## Features and principles

- Write your content in markdown and when ready simply "translate" it to a site that mirrors your source files.
- Supports multiple locales and versioning out-of-the-box. You can have both, or neither. It's fully configurable. 
- Comes with a boilerplate for reference, already prepared with versioning, light/dark mode and localization selection.

## Why Shromp?

Some time ago I decided to create documentation sites for some of my plugins and started looking into static site generators. I fell into the rabbit hole of frameworks, boilerplates and templates, and my head hurt!

I couldn't find an alternative that wasn't either bloated or too opinionated. I wanted something that was really static, with not many dependencies, and that supported locales and versioning out-of-the-box.

Well, the fact you are reading this signifies I didn't find anything to my taste and I thought it would be fun to build my own.

Go roam through these docs, which by the way, were developed with shromp. Maybe this is your cup of tea.
