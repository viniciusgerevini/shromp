# Known issues

## Big files issue (Image width cannot be greater than 16384px)

As per Godot's [docs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_image.html):

> The maximum image size is 16384Ã—16384 pixels due to graphics hardware limitations. Larger images may fail to import.

This plugin exports all animations as a single sprite sheet. If you are using a big canvas size in Aseprite with lots of frames, you may reach this limit.

Sprite sheets are generated using a `packing` algorithm, which should mitigate this issue, however, it won't solve it entirely.

You can workaround the issue by using an `AnimationPlayer` and splitting your animations in multiple Aseprite files. By enabling the `Hide unused sprites` option, you can import multiple files to different sprites in the same animation player and only the active one will be visible.

## Error message in the output console when automatically re-importing files

> Can't find file 'uid://...'.

You will likely see the error above (with the proper uid and path) when a re-import is triggered on file change. Even though this is an annoying message, it does not impact anything during import.

During the import process the spritesheet file is generated by Aseprite outside Godot. The plugin needs to trigger a file system scan so Godot is aware of the new files, but such scan throws this error message. At the moment, I don't have any workaround for that and other plugins are likely facing the same issue.
