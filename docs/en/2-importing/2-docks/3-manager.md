# Imports Manager

Importing animations via the Inspector Docks is handy, but it makes it harder to re-import multiple animations at same time. For that you can use the Imports Manager.

You can find the manager under `Project -> Tools -> Aseprite Wizard -> Imports Manager...`.

In this screen you can see all the nodes in your project imported using the Inspector Dock. From here, you can re-import any file, as well as select multiple files to import in one go.

Due to some limitations and bugs in Godot, when importing a node its scene will be open in the editor.
