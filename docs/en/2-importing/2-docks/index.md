# Import Dock

You can import animations directly to `AnimatedSprite` nodes and `AnimationPlayers` using the Inspector Dock. You can find the Aseprite section at the bottom of the Inspector Dock when selecting `AnimatedSprite2D`/`AnimatedSprite3D`/`Sprite2D`/`Sprite3D`/`TextureRect` nodes.

Animations imported via docks are only updated once you manually re-import them, giving more control on when imports happen and allowing others to run the project without having Aseprite installed.
